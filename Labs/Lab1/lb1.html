    <p>Hi my name is Mario, and I wrote this HTML code!<br>
  </br>I like to use the break tag as well.<br>
  </br>I am a CS student with some experience in Python and C++(pain in my butt). I'm hoping to advance my skills in HTML and looking forward to utilizing CSS, and am a bit anxious about JavaScript. However, I think I'll be fine. I just need to get used the syntax. I also have a Corgi and two Guinea Pigs that I rescued off the street last February.I'm currently taking Calculus and Discrete Mathematics in order to complete my degree, so I hope you will pray for me when I take my exams. I am also in the QCC Coding Club, Meeting on Wednesdays and this week we are going to learn about bootstrap.
